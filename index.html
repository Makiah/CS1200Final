			<p class="parallaxContent">The Major Mentor Event was a fascinating group conversation between upperclassmen who had made the choice to do a combined major, and underclassman who discovered why their decisions and thoughts might be applicable to disciplines which you are curious about.</p>
			<p class="parallaxContent">I had a great conversation with students from majors I hadn't even looked at closely prior and was fascinated by how prevalent those which I'd ignored prior could be in my future career.  Thus far I've chosen to remain "pure" BSCS, but this lesson was intriguing in showing me the other opportunities I haven't yet given myself the chance to explore.</p>

			<div class="sailExplanation">

				<p>Lifelong learning is all about understanding more about principles you hadn't yet given fair consideration.  I did so by discovering that stuff like Information Science and CS+Design has far more to do with modern CS than I'd previously believed.  </p>

			<div style="color: #777;background-color:white;text-align:center;padding:30px 80px;">
				<p class="parallaxContent">I started to learn about time management in high school, but throughout each of my four years, I had teachers to remind me to turn in assignments daily, and my classes would receive assignment reminder e-mails in the event that some large project was due soon.</p>
				<p class="parallaxContent">College is more impersonal by necessity, given the huge student population on campus.  As a result, ensuring that my schedule included all major events on campus as well as homework due dates, my capability to get the best possible grades is far better than it would be without effective time management techniques.  </p>

				<div class="sailExplanation">
					<img src="saillogo.png">
					<p>SAIL is all about SELF-AUTHORED learning, which effective time management skills enable.  Failure to establish these skills forces you to be largely reliant on others' ability to remind you (which is not feasible). </p>

				<p class="parallaxContent">Perhaps the most daunting aspect of a job search is effectively selling yourself (at least that's how I see it), since common courtesy encourages modesty, and coming off as brash or overly prideful will be a demerit toward your chances of being hired.</p>
				<p class="parallaxContent">Spending time in class to discover how to effectively structure, design, and write a resum√© was very helpful.  Additionally, this was the first time I've looked seriously at the co-op opportunities for Northeastern students, and spending time to carefully tailor my resume toward a specific technical position was something I hadn't yet done.  I think this will be valuable experience when co-op application season rolls around.</p>

				<div class="sailExplanation">
					<img src="saillogo.png">
					<p>Discovering how to sell yourself effectively is not a technical skill, so it's often underplayed in core CS curricula.  Ensuring that we can concisely and effectively explain our past and present accomplishments on paper for future employers is an important, self-authored skill.  </p>

			<p class="parallaxContent">I joined Karman in my first month at Northeastern, and it's been a fascinating experience all around.  Even though Arduino programming is extremely prevalent in engineering courses and underplayed in the computer science curriculum, I've learned a lot about driver programming and Arduino hardware from months of rocket construction and programming.  </p>
			<p class="parallaxContent">Since the intermediary rocket stage is still being constructed and the Kalman filter code is not complete I believe that we'll be doing our launch by the end of next semester, hopefully successfully!</p>
			<p class="parallaxContent">Integrating learning across disciplines is a key aspect of SAIL: Karman helps me to learn more about complex engineering principles and low-level aspects of CS which isn't typically covered in the CS curriculum.</p>

				<p class="parallaxContent">The Spotify representative who spoke to our group gave a fascinating explanation of how the music prediction algorithms are run and distributed to worldwide users.  These tasks are distributed to jobs and run via distributed computing clusters, and then incrementally improved as users listen to more music and the sample space grows.</p>
				<p class="parallaxContent">Although more heavy in data science principles than abstract coding concepts, the implementation behind what our lecturer explained is undoubtedly extremely complex.  I found this lecture helpful to understanding more about the concepts of "Big Data" which seems so cryptic without a solid example of such an implementation.</p>

				<p class="parallaxContent">This was a fascinating documentary which clearly explains how Lorraine Hansberry shows two distinct sides of the American Dream via <em>Raisin in the Sun</em>.  It's good to see that activism existed in film form even when film was far less prevalent in our daily lives</p>

		<p>To future Northeastern students:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If you've never tried sushi before, re-evaluate your life choices and grab some at IV.  It's not the best sushi in town but it's free, and you can grab more than one of those tiny 3-piece plates if nobody's looking.  It'll probably change your life, or at least show you that raw fish tastes better than it sounds.  Too many of the people I've met here have never tried it (months into their first semester!!).  </li>
			<li>Procrastination is often given a bad rap.  For some assignments, knowing that you're everything til the last day and successfully getting it over with in one fell swoop saves you the stress of thinking about how you really ought to be doing said assignment up until the day it's due.  Getting it out of your mind to focus on more pressing issues is a far better idea (at least as far I've experiened), BUT with the caveat that you need to take a long hard look at the assignment before you decide to procrastinate.  Always make sure you have the ability to finish it in its entirety in a single day BEFORE you push it off to the last possible day.</li>
			<li>Snell is ALWAYS packed.  There is literally no time of day during the entirety of the semester when you can't walk in and have to spend a couple minutes looking for somewhere to sit.  If you want to walk out and study/work on side projects/whatever outside of your room, go literally anywhere else (I personally can't focus while surrounded by a bunch of people chattering away about their own stuff).  "Well, where do I go?" you ask?  Figure that out on your own since I don't want where I go to become Snell all over again.</li>
